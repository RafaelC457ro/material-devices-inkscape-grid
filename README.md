# material-devices-inkscape-grid
I used this code to generate SVG-Inkscape files with grids guidelines, based on
[Material Design Device Metrics](https://material.io/devices/).
So, you can use this to create your app or webpage wireframes using Inkscape and
Material Design rules.

## how to use?

Just open any file in SVG directory using [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
application and start using.
